# Biography

I am a third-year undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, majoring in Computer Science & Engineering. My interests include Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and the application of Deep Learning in these fields. At IIT Roorkee, I worked with <a href="http://bbanerjee.netlify.com/">Dr. Biplab Banerjee</a> on Human Action Detection in Videos and Zero-Shot Learning. I also worked with <a href="http://profs.etsmtl.ca/mpedersoli/">Dr. Marco Pedersoli</a> and Jose Dolz at ETS Montreal in the summer of 2018 on Group-Level Emotion Recognition.

I am currently interning at the <a href="http://val.serc.iisc.ernet.in/">Video Analytics Lab</a> in IISc Bangalore where I'm working on developing a DL-based metric to quantify Deghosting in HDR Images.
