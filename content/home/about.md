# Biography

I am a third-year undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, majoring in Computer Science & Engineering. My interests include Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and the application of Deep Learning in these fields.

At IIT Roorkee, I worked with <a href="http://bbanerjee.netlify.com/">Dr. Biplab Banerjee</a> on Human Action Detection in Videos and Zero-Shot Learning. I also worked with <a href="http://profs.etsmtl.ca/mpedersoli/">Dr. Marco Pedersoli</a> and Jose Dolz at ETS Montreal in the summer of 2018 on Group-Level Emotion Recognition. I recently interned at the  <a href="http://val.serc.iisc.ernet.in/">Video Analytics Lab</a> in IISc Bangalore where I worked on developing a neural network to generate HDR images from exposure stacks. 

I'll be joining the <a href="https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/">Visual Computing Group</a> at Harvard University in May 2019 for my summer internship. I have also been selected for the SN Bose Scholars Program 2019.
